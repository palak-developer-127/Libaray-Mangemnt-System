                        <p>
                            Our library was started by a group of enthusiastic youngsters in 1976 under the guidance of Mr. Vrajlal S. Kamani to help the students of the lower socioeconomic strata by
                            distribution of books at low cost in the form of a book bank. Late on Mr. Valjibhai Kesari , them Known batter as the Lion of Saurashtra agreed to donate a huge amount for library purpose. This led to the
                            development of today’s  Library.
